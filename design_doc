Design Document:
	We approached this program doing some minor testing that we formed ourselves moving up to a framework.
	We plan to implement the catch framework to allow us to easily test new functionality.
	Using Catch to test our functionality, will allowed us to expedite the testing process.
	
	Our boards are being built from one vector to simulate a 2d array. Each position in this vector is modifiable
	to show different board states. One to show open water one to show a boat undamaged and one to show a secection of a damged boat.
	The board itself should not be able to move to the playing state if doesnt pass our starting tests for being ok for setting up the board.
	
	Planning on using SDL to create the graphics our user will see.
	However we want also want to add a version of it which is being printed out in ASCII art for the board.
	That way if the user lacks the required files it still has a rudementry backup.
	
	Are pin which the user uses to sign in for his turn will also need to be saved into the save state.
	
	Planning to implement save states by pushing off board state to a file. Those locations of modified spots
	allows us to have them swap it in easy bacause it can just be re-assigned over a normal vector.
	If we can save it easily in a non human readable form that loads back in good as well that is the plan.
