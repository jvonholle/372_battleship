        vector<int> myBoard[100]
                -1 - missed shot
                 0 - empty water
                 1 - ship
                 2 - hit ship
        vector<int> theirBoard[100]
                 same as myBoard
                 should never have 1 ** INVARIANT **
        int pin
                randomly generated pin
                needed to print at start of turn
        map<string, ship> ships
            struct ship
                knows size
                    int based on what ship it is
                knows position
                    pair int, char that contain its aft location and orientation
                knows if sunk
                    int for health(default starts at size), prints message when it hits 0
                knows if placed
                    bool from place call
    member functions
        char takeFire(int coord)
            takes int, returns char
                checks spot on board for ship
                    if ship, mark hit on ship, decrement health, return H
                    if miss, do nothing, return M
                    else, return R
        bool place(string shipName, int coord, char rot)
            takes string, int, char, returns bool
                positions ship at given coord and orientation
                    int - coord
                        position of stern (rear of ship)
                    char - orientation
                        U - Up - Ship goes up from given position
                        R - Right - Ship goes right from given position
                        L - Left - Ship goes left from given position
                        D - Down - Ship goes down from given position
                does not allow ships in bad pos - if given orientation leads off map, try again
        void print(int pin)
            takes int, returns nothing
                checks pin against data member pin, if it matches print, if not ask again 5 times, if wrong 5 times, end game
                prints member vectors
                my board bigger and with ascii ships

    board tests
        data member checks
            check myBoard
                size should be 100
                no values lower than -1 or higher than 2
            check theirBoard
                size should be 100
                should be zeros until a shot, then only -1 0 or 2
            check pin
                should be positive random int with 3 digits
            check ships
                should be in good positions - not off board or diagonal
                named ships should have correct health and size
            check ship
                should know size
                should know position
                health should be positive until sunk, then 0
                health should only go down when hit on fresh spot
                should know if sunk
                should know if placed
        member function checks
                check fire
                    hit should hit
                    miss should miss
                    should return R on attemnt to hit used spot
                check place
                    should return false if fail
                    should position ship correctly
